# GraduationProject

This project is about Multi-agent Path-finding(MAPF) problem. 
We use stateless Q-learning(one type of RL) to train agents for learning routes.
We consider task series was given(input by user, in our case).
Because we can dynamically solve problem, this task series can be infinite long.
